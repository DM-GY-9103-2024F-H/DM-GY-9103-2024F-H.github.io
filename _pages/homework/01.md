    ## GitHub (3 points)

    This part of the assignment is to guarantee that we all have our tools and accounts setup for the rest of the course. There are 2 mandatory tasks that should be completed:

    1\. Set up a GitHub account. Once you have an account, submit your username or profile link via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).

    2\. Set up a GitHub organization for keeping your class project files. This will help keep class files organized. Submit your organization name or a profile link via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).

    ## JavaScript to Python (10 points)

    1\. Download the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download) and install Python mode. You can follow these [instructions](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/) or watch the first part of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDJ6x2z1-TA).

    2\. Translate one of your Creative Coding JavaScript homeworks into Python. If you don't have a Creative Coding homework assignment, you can use one of these:
      - [HW03A](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/HW03A), [HW03B](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/HW03B), [HW03C](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/HW03C), [HW04A](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/HW04/tree/main/A)

    3\. Translate one of your Creative Coding JavaScript projects into Python. If you don't have a Creative Coding project, you can use one of these:
      - [MidTerm Project](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/MidTerm-Project), [Procedural Drawing Machine](https://editor.p5js.org/thiagohersan/sketches/p6h71pXE7), [Glitchy Typewriter](https://editor.p5js.org/thiagohersan/sketches/KJO5CEwKM)

    4\. Upload the two Processing projects to GitHub. You can follow the second part of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDJ6x2z1-TA) to see how to do that.

    ## Submission
    Upload the code to GitHub and use [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565) to submit GitHub links to your user profile, your organization profile and the two repositories with your Python code. Also include copies of the original JavaScript code in your repository, or provide a link to a editor.p5js.org sketch.
