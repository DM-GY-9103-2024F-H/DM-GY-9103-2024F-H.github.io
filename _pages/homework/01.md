    ## GitHub (3 points)

    This part of the assignment is to guarantee that we all have our tools and accounts setup for the rest of the course. There are 2 mandatory tasks that should be completed:

    1. Set up a GitHub account. Once you have an account, submit your username or profile link via Brightspace.

    2. Set up a GitHub organization for keeping your class project files. This will help keep class files organized. Submit your organization name or a profile link via Brightspace.

    ## JavaScript to Python (10 points)

    1\. Download the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download) and install Python mode. You can follow these [instructions](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/).
