    ## Some exercises with Lists, Plots and Data Analysis
    1\. Use the [HW03 template](https://github.com/DM-GY-9103-2024F-H/HW03) to start a repository in your organization's GitHub space. It should be named HW03. Open the notebook file using GitHub Codespaces to continue the exercises.

    2\. Complete as many of the exercises in the notebook as you can.

    3\. Keep your Codespaces files synchronized with your repository. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J4jmLaJRnw) for some tips. And, even though it shows a different Git interface, [this tutorial](https://idmp5.github.io/intro/git/) is also a good review of Git / GitHub concepts.

    4\. Submit a link to your repository with the completed exercises using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).
