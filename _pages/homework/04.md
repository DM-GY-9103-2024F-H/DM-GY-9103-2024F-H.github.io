  title: "Big Data & Media: What do we know when we can't tell how we know?"
  intro: "Read and write a 200-word response to the following:"
  description: |
    Your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what are the texts about?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - What does it have to do with programming?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/).

    Alternatively, you may create a ```reading.md``` file in your HW04 repo and write your response in markdown. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/).

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |
