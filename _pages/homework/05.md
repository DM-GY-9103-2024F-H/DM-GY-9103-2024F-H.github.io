  title: "Media representation and mis-representation"
  intro: "Read and write a 200-word response to the following:"
  description: |
    This is not the easiest reading of the semester. Not because it's super academic, but as an artist and media theorist, [Hito Steyerl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hito_Steyerl) can sometimes seem a bit too poetic or cryptic. She is also very sarcastic, anti-capitalist and anti-war.

    The required reading is an essay she wrote in 2016 about data, images and patterns, when [unexpected results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream) from Google's computer vision models were a relatively new thing.

    The other link is to one of her earlier essays about images and the politics of collecting images. This is optional, but is here for historical and aesthetic context. It might have a different interpretation nowadays with the popularization of NFTs and other digital/crypto collecting practices.

    The other two required "readings" are videos about older technologies for encoding and decoding information. Even before our current "everything is a number" moment, people have used clever mechanisms for compressing, storing and transmitting information.

    Your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what are the texts about?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How does it inform what we're doing with programming?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).

    Alternatively, you may create a `HW05` repo and write your response in markdown in a `README.md` file. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).

    Grading for the reading response will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |
