    Your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what are these texts about?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - Was there anything in the texts that surprised you? What? Why?

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|

    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |
