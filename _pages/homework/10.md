  title: "Classic Papers: A little bit of technical reading."
  intro: "Read and write a 200-word response to the following:"
  description: |
    This is a different kind of reading. This is one of the classic articles about a very powerful neural network architecture. Instead of trying to fully understand all of the details of the paper, you can focus on the high-level aspects and implications of the ideas presented.

    Use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is this paper about?
    - How are CNNs different from previous technologies used in this field?
    - Do you have any questions about any of the content of the paper?
    - What would you ask its authors if you could?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/).

    Alternatively, you may create a ```reading.md``` file in your HW10 repo and write your response in markdown. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/).

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |
