    ## Some exercises with Tensors
    0\. Finish going through the [Tensors Notebook](https://github.com/DM-GY-9103-2024F-H/WK11/blob/main/WK11-tensors.ipynb) from class.

    1\. Use the [HW11 template](https://github.com/DM-GY-9103-2024F-H/HW11) to start a repository in your organization's GitHub space. It should be named HW11. Open the notebook file using GitHub Codespaces to continue the exercises.

    2\. Complete the exercises in the notebook and answer any interpretation questions.

    3\. Submit a link to your repository with the completed exercises using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).

    ## Project
    ### Milestone 02: Data and Some Preliminary Graphs

    #### The Data

    What kind of data do you need for your project ? How is it available ?

    For this milestone you should start working with the data that you will use. If you still haven't focused your project into a single idea and are still considering a few possibilities, this step should help you make a decision.

    How much data do you have ? What's in it ? What format is it in ? 

    Do you have features and outcome variables, just features, or something else ?

    Does it make sense to describe the data in terms of its distribution ? Does it have a mean, or a most common set of values?

    Create a notebook to go through the data that you have and explore it.

    Start getting it ready for modeling. Does it need to go into a `DataFrame` ? `Tensor` ? Something else ? Does it have to be encoded ? scaled ? normalized ?

    Some of your data samples might have empty columns. What do you do about this missing data ?

    #### Some Graphs

    Visualize your data. Does it make sense to plot features and their distributions ?

    If working with audio, image or other media files, can you show what you have with histograms or other types of plots ?

    #### Submission

    Document your research, any new ideas and write a description of your data in your `Project` repository on GitHub. Use the same repository as Milestone 01.

    Create a notebook for some data exploration and include that in the repository as well.

    Submit a link to this repository through [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).

    #### Future Milestones

    - Milestone 03 - 2024/12/03: Initial Modeling/Programming.
    - Milestone 04 - 2024/12/10: Tuning and Adjusting.
    - Milestone 05 - 2024/12/17: Final Presentation and Discussion
