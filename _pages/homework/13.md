    ## Some exercises with VAEs
    1\. Use the [HW13 template](https://github.com/DM-GY-9103-2024F-H/HW13) to start a repository in your organization's GitHub space. It should be named HW10. Open the notebook file using GitHub Codespaces to continue the exercises.

    2\. Complete the exercises in the notebook. Like last week, there are some interpretation questions on this one.

    3\. Submit a link to your repository with the completed exercises using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).
