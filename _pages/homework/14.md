    ## Project
    ### Milestone 05: Final code, final documentation, final thoughts

    #### The Code

    For this milestone your code should be finished and organized.

    The code has been cleaned up, all the cells in your notebook are necessary for your project, and can be executed in order without errors. All the experimental code and debugging commands have been removed, or moved to a different file.

    You can have multiple notebook files, and regular python files, as long as you specify which files are part of your final submission.

    #### The Words

    Write a report explaining your project. This is an expansion of your initial proposal.

    It should have an intro, where you explain why this was interesting to you, then some paragraphs that explain the different modeling/analysis techniques that you tried and what you thought would happen. So, describe the data and models that you wanted to use, and specify which ones you actually used. Did you want to compare `scikit-learn` models with `PyTorch` models ?

    Then, a section with documentation about what did happen. If you have plots, images, graphs, poems, diagrams, etc etc ... they should be in this section with a brief explanation about how they were used. Were they used to validate the model ? Or were they the output of your model? Or part of the analysis ? Or the beginning of a future research project ?

    And then, finally, a conclusion section where you reflect on what the results that you got actually mean, or could mean. Are there further steps you'd like to take ? Is there a different direction you could've explored ? Any final thoughts or considerations ?

    #### The Format

    This report can be made using whatever tool you're most comfortable using for writing reports or papers. It can be a Google Doc, a website, a Markdown file on GitHub, a LaTeX document, or, even a Python Jupyter notebook. Being able to mix text, images and code is one of the benefits of notebooks, so it would be fitting to write the report in a notebook.

    #### Submission

    Submit a link to your repository through [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407565).

    If your report is not in your repository, then also send a link to your report in the Brightspace submission form.

    #### Final Presentations

    Bring some images/screenshots to class on Tuesday to present you project to the class. If you want you can also run the project live, but it's nice to have a backup plan.

    This doesn't have to be formal. No slides or presentations, just some images to project and illustrate your project and its results.
