    Your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is this text about?

    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - What does it have to do with programming?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/).

    Alternatively, you may create a `reading.md` file in your HWXX repo and write your response in markdown. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/).

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|

    - How are CNNs different from previous technologies used in this field?
